To compile, from the taka2/backup directory:

cd build && cmake .. && make && cd ../

OpenCV ver >= 3.0 is required. Output will be the taca.app executable located on taka2/backup. Run as ./gkRef.app

A sample video named test.avi should be located inside the taka2/backup/vids directory in order to run the code. Output videos -if there are any- will be generated on the same directory.

A sample video can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pycprE_4BUgKuSTetIU_u4QtHD_sFYdg/view?usp=sharing)
